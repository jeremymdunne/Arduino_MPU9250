This is a library for the MPU9250 9 DOF IMU sensor. It is made to run on arduinos. 

I am currently developing this using the STM32f103C8 and will test other platforms once done. 

This uses complementary filters to combine the gyro/accel/mag data into the orientation on the XYZ planes. 

This is still a work in progress, use with caution.
